    <h1>Portfolio Project 2: JavaScript Essentials</h1>

    <p><strong>Project Purpose:</strong> Presentation of interactive data</p>
    <p>In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Main Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
    <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Google Charts</p>

    <!-- Project Ideas -->
    <details open>
      <summary>Project Ideas</summary>
      <p>You can either choose to build the website based on Project Idea 0, or take inspiration from the other example ideas below.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Idea 0:</strong> Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as a guide to the minimum required functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 1:</strong> Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users want to play an online game that has elements of chance.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The site's goal is to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> Pattern matching functionality, a limited number of tries before the game is over, a score tracking system, the ability to play against the computer.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 2:</strong> Build an Online Quiz<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users want to play an online quiz to test general/specific knowledge such as sports/movies/literary knowledge or personality assessment.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The goal of the site is to provide a challenging quiz to entertain online users.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> A score tracking system, images to support the correct/incorrect answers, user can create a username, feedback.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 3:</strong> Build a NaturalWorld/Sport/Finance/Geopolitical Trends Website<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users are interested in gaining insights into data relationships representing particular events or activities.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The site's goal is to provide easily digestible data representations that lead to user actionable insights.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> Charting functionality to represent the data in an easily digestible manner, supporting facts surrounding the data and any insights gleaned from the data.</p>

      <h3>Merit Performance Overview</h3>
      <p>The learner has a clear rationale for developing this project and has produced a fully functioning, well-documented, interactive web application for a real-life audience, with specific content rather than placeholders.

    <details>
      <summary>Assessment Criteria â€” Distinction</summary>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance as described below.</p>
      
      <h3>Distinction Performance Overview</h3>
      <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application. The development of the project has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive web application.</p>
      
      <p>The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no logic errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate and acceptable to the target user. It matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit.</p>

      <h3>Amplification (Craftsmanship)</h3>
      
      <h4>Design</h4>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Information Hierarchy</strong></summary>
        <ul>

          <li>When displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio; instead letting the user initiate and control such actions <input type="checkbox" id="p2-d-uc-2"></li>
          <li>The user is shown progress indicators where relevant <input type="checkbox" id="p2-d-uc-3"></li>
