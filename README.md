# 🧾 Portfolio Project Checklist

[Click here for Live Demo](https://tindyc.github.io/FS_Assessment_Criteria_Checklist/)

## Overview  
The **Portfolio Project Checklist** is a quick and practical web tool I created for my students to use **before submitting their assessments**.  

It provides a simple way for students to review all the Code Institute **Portfolio Project 1–5 assessment criteria** and tick off items as they complete them.  

This helps ensure that students meet all **Pass**, **Merit**, and **Distinction** standards and feel confident that their projects are ready for submission.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This checklist was created to:  
- Support students in verifying their work against each project’s assessment criteria.  
- Help students understand the expectations at each grading level.  
- Encourage self-assessment and accountability before submission.  
- Provide a single, consistent reference point for all five portfolio projects.

## 🧩 Features  
✅ **Separate Pages for PP1–PP5**  
- Each page includes full project details, learning outcomes, and assessment criteria.  
- Collapsible sections for better readability.  
- Checkbox tables to track Pass, Merit, and Distinction progress.  

✅ **Automatic Progress Saving via LocalStorage**  
- Each checkbox is stored in the browser using **LocalStorage**, so progress is saved automatically.  
- No internet connection or login is needed — all data stays on the user’s own device.  
- Each project page (PP1–PP5) saves its progress independently.  

✅ **Accessible, Mobile-Friendly Design**  
- Uses a clean, responsive layout consistent with Code Institute’s colour theme.  
- Structured tables and semantic HTML for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** — semantic page structure  
- **CSS3** — reusable design system shared across all pages  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — handles checkbox interaction and saves progress  
- **LocalStorage API** — preserves each user’s checklist progress automatically  
- **GitHub Pages** — for hosting and sharing the site

3. Tick each criterion as you complete it.  
4. Your progress is automatically saved in the browser using **LocalStorage**.  
5. You can close or refresh the page — your checked boxes remain saved!
