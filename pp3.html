    <h1>Portfolio Project 3: Python Essentials</h1>

    <p><strong>Project purpose:</strong><br>
      In this project, you'll build a command-line application that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.</p>

    <p><strong>Main Technologies</strong><br>
      Required: Python</p>

    <!-- Project Ideas -->
    <details open>
      <summary>Project Ideas</summary>
      <p>You can either choose to build the website based on Project Idea 0, or take inspiration from the other example ideas below.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Idea 0</strong><br>
        Bring your idea(s) to life based on providing value to users to address a specific factual or imagined need. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as a guide to the minimum required functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 1</strong><br>
        Analyse Survey Data</p>
      <p><em>External user’s goal:</em><br>
        The application user wants to glean insights from survey results.</p>
      <p><em>Site owner's goal:</em><br>
        The application should provide actionable insights from an inputted dataset.</p>
      <p><em>Potential features to include:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import survey results from the terminal, structured data file or similar.</li>
        <li>Parse and analyse the data</li>
        <li>Export the results to an appropriate file</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 2</strong><br>
        A Battleships game</p>
      <p><em>External user’s goal:</em><br>
        The application user wants to play a logic game</p>
      <p><em>Site owner's goal:</em><br>
        The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
        The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer .e.g.</p>
      <p><em>Potential features to include:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability for the user to set the grid size</li>
        <li>Warn the user if their guess is off-grid</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Assessment Criteria — Merit</summary>

      <p>To evidence performance at the MERIT level, a learner will, in general, demonstrate characteristics of performance at the MERIT level, as suggested below. However, the learner must achieve ALL listed merit criteria.</p>

      <p>The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, documented application for a real-life audience. Data validation and user feedback are all evident in the code and the working application. There are no logic errors in the code, and the application functions as expected.</p>

      <p>The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences) and a specific data domain. Its purpose would be immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation. The user is kept informed of progress and actions through feedback and, where large data sets are being loaded, progress indicators.</p>

      <p>Code is well-organised and easy to follow, and the application has been fully tested, following a manual testing procedure, with no apparent errors left in the code.</p>

      <p>The development process is evident through commit messages. The project’s documentation provides a clear rationale for the development of this project.</p>

      <p>The application is robust and deals with external errors gracefully (user input).</p>

    <!-- Distinction Criteria -->
    <details>
      <summary>Assessment Criteria — Distinction</summary>

      <p>At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, as described above, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance as described below:</p>

      <h3>Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION level:</h3>

      <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application</p>

      <p>The development of the project has resulted in a fully-functioning Python application with a command-line interface</p>

      <p>There are no logic errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate and acceptable to the target user. It matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit</p>

      <h3>Amplification (craftsmanship)</h3>

        <li>Users are never asked for information that the application already has. <input type="checkbox" id="p3-d-uc-2"></li>
        <li>Errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to the user. <input type="checkbox" id="p3-d-uc-3"></li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Defensive design</h4>
