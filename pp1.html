    <h1>Portfolio Project 1: HTML/CSS Essentials</h1>

    <p><strong>Project Purpose:</strong> Static front-end website</p>
    <p>In this project, you'll build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.</p>
    <p>Data is presented to help users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service in which they are interested. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.</p>
    <p><strong>Main Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS</p>

    <!-- Project Ideas -->
    <details open>
      <summary>Project Ideas</summary>
      <p>You can either choose to build the website based on Project Idea 0, or take inspiration from the other example ideas below.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Idea 0:</strong> Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as a guide to the minimum required functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 1:</strong> Build a History website<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users are interested in the historical facts surrounding a particular artefact, person, place or event.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The goal of the site is to provide a reliable source of information pertaining to the history of a particular artefact, person, place or event.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> A timeline of events, evidence-based information, images/video supporting the facts.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 2:</strong> Build a Lifehacks website<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users are interested in solving everyday problems in an intuitive and engaging way.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The goal of the site is to be the primary source of solutions to genuinely useful life hacks.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> Lifehack categories and supporting information, supporting text/images/video demonstrating the life hack.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Example Idea 3:</strong> Build a Meditation/Mindfulness/Yoga Website<br>
      <em>External user's goal:</em> The site's users are interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques.<br>
      <em>Site owner's goal:</em> The goal of the site is to teach users specific body/mind self-improvement techniques.<br>
      <em>Potential features to include:</em> Technique categories and supporting information, technique lessons, supporting text/images/video demonstrating the technique.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> When choosing a portfolio project, it is best practice to choose a new topic to avoid duplicating HTML/CSS code, as it can only be graded once.</p>

      <h3>Merit Performance Overview</h3>
      <p>The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, well-documented website for a real-life audience.</p>
      
      <p>The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences).

    <details>
      <summary>Assessment Criteria — Distinction</summary>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance as described below.</p>
      
      <h3>Distinction Performance Overview</h3>
      <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application and a comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed.</p>
      
      <p>The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no obvious errors in the code.</p>
      
      <p>Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate, and acceptable to the target user. It clearly matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the course.</p>

      <h3>Amplification (Craftsmanship)</h3>
      
      <h4>Design</h4>
